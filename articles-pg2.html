									<h3>A National Crisis</h3>
									<p>
										<strong
                        >Witnessing the challenges facing other countries during
                        the emerging COVID-19 pandemic allowed Ireland to plan
                        in advance its response to the crisis.</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) were
										highlighted as a critical issue for frontline healthcare
										staff - placing these workers at high risk of infection
										and reducing the ability of healthcare services to save
										lives. Governments and public health officials were faced
										with the considerable challenge of obtaining sufficient
										quantities of PPE on competitive international markets.
									</p>
									<p>
										Face shields are an essential component of PPE for
										healthcare providers treating patients with confirmed or
										suspected COVID-19 infection. In Ireland, this includes
										the large number of frontline healthcare workers in
										COVID-19 testing centres, community assessment hubs and
										nursing homes.
									</p>
									<p>
										In anticipation of the needs of these healthcare workers,
										a number of manufacturing companies in Ireland had started
										developing face shields. However, it would be weeks before
										these were available to the Health Service Executive (HSE)
										for purchase. Because of this, a gap was expected between
										the immediate needs of Irish healthcare workers and the availability of a reliable supply of PPE,
										including face shields.</p>

									<h3>The Open Source PPE Project</h3>
									<p>
										<strong
                        >In the fourth week of March 2020, as the number of
                        COVID-19 cases in Ireland passed 1,000, several
                        organisations in Cork were working to meet the needs of
                        Irish healthcare workers for face shields.</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Such group of engineering and regulatory professionals
										from local healthcare industries had started prototyping
										designs and working with healthcare organisations to test
										them. At the same time, the staff and members of
										Benchspace - Corkâ€™s shared manufacturing hub - brought
										together a national network of 3D printers and established
										a crowdfunding platform to finance face shield production.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Open Source PPE project began as a collaboration
										between these two groups. We combined our expertise to
										bridge the gap between the immediate needs of Irish
										healthcare workers for face shields and the anticipated
										arrival of a commercial supply. To achieve this we were
										joined by a coalition of nonprofits, industry partners,
										the Irish Defence Forces and over three hundred
										3D-printing, collection, and assembly hub volunteers.
									</p>
									<p>
										Together these Open Source PPE volunteers built a
										nationwide manufacturing network, established three
										central assembly hubs, and in just seven weeks, produced
										over 50,000 face shields for frontline healthcare workers
										in COVID-19 test centres, community assessment hubs and
										nursing homes.
									</p>
									<h3>3D Printers Unite</h3>
									<p>
										<strong
                        >A Micro-Factory Network. As stay-at-home restrictions
                        were introduced across Ireland, we opened a national
                        campaign to recruit volunteers with access to 3D
                        printers.</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										This began with a simple social media call, reaching out
										to Irelandâ€™s maker community. It soon grew to include
										local and national newspapers, alongside radio and
										television coverage. In the first few days of the
										campaign, 80 volunteers signed up to participate in our
										micro-factory network. This increased daily, to a network
										of over 300 volunteers nationwide.
									</p>
									<p>
										The majority of these volunteers were individuals with
										home-based 3D printers. They included hobbyists,
										professionals, students, and families. Our youngest
										volunteer was just 10 years of age. Many came from
										Irelandâ€™s engineering community; after Engineers Ireland
										promoted the Open Source PPE project to its members. As
										the network expanded, it was joined by volunteer
										organisations with access to large numbers of 3D printers.
										These included schools, libraries, institutes of
										technology, universities, industry and the Irish Defence
										Forces. Where these organisations could not participate
										directly, they generously loaned their 3D printers to
										volunteers in the network instead.
									</p>

										Many volunteers went beyond 3D printing to provide online
										technical support, develop our website, coordinate the
										national collection service and establish assembly hubs.
										The Open Source PPE project could not have happened
										without their contributions.
