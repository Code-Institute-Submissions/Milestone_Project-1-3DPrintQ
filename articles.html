								<p>As the world continues to develop rapid responses to slow the spread of COVID-19,
									many
									eyes have been turned to the maker community. On-demand, localized manufacturing
									made
									possible through technologies including 3-D printing (additive manufacturing) is
									helping
									in stop-gap supply provision for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other
									needed-now goods.</p>
									<p>Alongside major industrial 3-D printing companies — like Carbon, HP, Formlabs,
										Desktop
										Metal, Stratasys, and 3D System — coming to the fore of global efforts, is a
										relatively
										small company dedicated to desktop 3-D printers.
										Prusa Research, based in Czechia, is proving itself to be 3-D printing’s city on
										a
										hill
										in terms of pandemic response. <div class="collapse" id="collapseArticleOne">
											<div class="col pl-0">
												<p>In three days, Founder Josef Prusa and his team at Prusa Research
													designed,
													prototyped, verified, and began mass production of
													medical-appropriate
													face
													shields with both 3-D printed and laser cut plastic components.
													Approved
													by
													the Czech Ministry of Health — including Minister of Health Adam
													Vojtech
													—
													the face shields moved quickly to field testing, full approval, and
													large-scale production.<figure class="float-right img-wrap img-thumbnail"><img src="assets/images/prusafaceshield.jpg" class="img-fluid padding" alt="A prusa 3d printed face shield"><figcaption class="pl-1"><small class="text-muted">Prusa Protective Face Shield - RC3 PRUSA RESEARCH</small></figcaption></figure> They have donated 12,000-plus of the masks
													throughout Czechia. The design also spread at the speed of the
													internet,
													and
													downloads in the thousands saw the design rapidly disseminated to
													all
													corners of the world.</p>
												<p>Many makers have been inspired by the quick turnaround of digital
													design
													and
													digital manufacturing to turn their own 3-D printers to use. There
													are,
													however, a right way and a lot of wrong ways to go about using 3-D
													printing
													to actually be helpful in the face of pandemic.</p>
												<div class="col align-self-end">
													<blockquote>
														<cite><strong>“It really is incredible. It is just eight days now, and our whole planet, all the 3-D printers are printing face shields. I would never have expected 3-D printing to act so quickly. It is wonderful,” Josef Prusa told me this week in a Skype interview. “I expect in a week or two, traditional supply will kick in for technologies for better manufacturing like injection molding, and then it will take like two weeks to start making them. Until then, the 3-D printing community can make a big impact. Today we will be finishing 20,000 face shields made just by us, basically in just a week. In our small country, it will have a big impact.”</strong></cite>
													</blockquote>
												</div>
												<p>That big impact is not relegated to small countries; the face shield,
													now
													on
													its third iteration, has been downloaded so many times the Prusa
													team
													had to
													turn off their download counter to avoid overloading the servers.
													<cite>“Before we turned it off, the face shield had about 101,000 downloads,”</cite>
													Prusa said.</p>
												<p>Among those downloading the design have been individual makers doing
													what
													they can for their local communities’ needs as well as large-scale
													enterprises. This weekend, the University of Michigan approved the
													Prusa
													design for its medical equipment donation drive. The Prusa logo is
													also
													visible on the face shields that the team at Ford has been creating
													using
													its in-house 3-D printer fleet; Ford has announced the intent to
													produce
													75,000 face shields in its first week of such production.<figure class="img-wrap float-left pr-4 img-thumbnail"><img src="assets/images/communitymakes.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Prusa face shields used in the community"><figurecaption><small class="text-muted">Prusa face shields used in the community</small></figurecaption></figure></p>
												<p>These face shields are a major help in the global scramble for
													appropriate
													PPE, which is in short supply. While many 3-D printing efforts first
													turned
													to face masks or parts for respirators, many such designs to appear
													could do
													more harm than good with a false sense of security or dangerous
													ineffectiveness. Validating good designs that can be effectively
													created
													and
													provide actual safeguards from the spread of the novel coronavirus
													is
													critical. The value of 3-D printing is the ability to fill such
													needs
													now,
													while traditional manufacturing ramps up its response to the mass
													supplies
													needed.</p>
												<p>Prusa’s team was uniquely positioned to step in to create an
													effective
													design. Recently labelled as one of Deloitte’s fastest-growing
													companies
													in
													the EMEA region, around 200,000 Prusa 3-D printers have been shipped
													worldwide. Prusa Research also maintains expertise in design,
													offering a
													repository of 3-D printable design files. Building upon a face
													shield
													design
													they found to improve it for safety and comfort, the Prusa design
													team
													went
													through iterations and verification rounds with the Czech Minister
													of
													Health
													before releasing the file. Turning all of their printers to this one
													purpose, rather than for 3-D printing parts for new 3-D printers
													(about
													30%
													of each Prusa 3-D printer is 3-D printed on Prusa 3-D printers; say
													that
													three times fast), their in-house print farm of about 600 3-D
													printer
													started making 800 shields per day, quickly ramping up to 3,000 per
													day.
												</p>
												<p>As the design spreads and more 3-D printers around the world are
													churning
													out
													thousands of these face shields, Prusa is making sure to include
													necessary 
													cautions regarding the production of any PPE to be donated.</p>
												<p><cite>“Even though you are quarantined at home it does not mean you are not infected. Any equipment you want to give hospitals, you need to act like you’re infected, and use at least a face mask while around the printers. We know when the print is finished that it is sterile because of the high printing temperatures. When you touch it, you should always put on sterile gloves, or at least use a new plastic bag and grab the part through the plastic bag so there is the least amount of possibility of contaminating the part. Everyone should always consult with the hospital or the people they are giving it to about their production environment so it is safe. Always, they will need to sterilize or disinfect in the hospital before they actually use it,”</cite>
													Prusa cautions.</p>
												<p>Upping the standards for their design, the Prusa team has worked with
													labs in
													Czechia to ensure effectiveness against the exact virus plaguing the
													world.
													<cite>“They have live COVID cultures,”</cite> Prusa explained of the
													labs,
													<cite>“so we are now testing ways to safely sterilize with this in the field. We should be having some guides and verified tests from the labs in upcoming days so we can guide the community what to do, tell doctors what really works when working with infected patients.”</cite>
												</p>
												<p>Educating the community is key for all the homegrown efforts to bring
													3-D
													printers to help. <figure class="float-right img-wrap img-thumbnail"><img src="assets/images/communityassembly.jpg" class="img-fluid padding" alt="A community assembling 3d printed face shields"><figcaption class="pl-1"><small class="text-muted">A community assembling 3d printed face shields</small></figcaption></figure>Prusa himself is very active on Twitter, often
													reaching
													out when he sees photos of face shields made but just lying on the
													floor;
													<cite>“I try to send information on how to do it safely,”</cite>
													Prusa
													says.
													<cite>“Many people we worked with previously with medical facilities, and we have loads of printers around the world, so we have thought about these things, but if you are a maker at home you may not have thought about it before.”</cite>
												</p>
												<p>Looking beyond the face shields, the team at Prusa Research is also
													in
													early
													stages of exploring designs for goggles with indirect ventilation.
													These
													goggles will require more work before their verification and file
													release,
													but represent another step forward in makeable, useful PPE. Prusa
													Research
													has also been running contests for other designs outside of safety
													gear
													that
													requires verification, such as
													<cite>“stuff like how to open doors safely without touching the doorknob, or stuff you might run out of if you are at home and cannot go to a shop,”</cite>
													Prusa says.</p>
												<p>Preparation has been key to Prusa Research’s approach to the current
													conditions. Prusa released a blog about why it’s “important to be
													two
													steps
													ahead,” detailing his team’s efforts to operate safely — which have
													been
													quite effective, as they have to date had zero cases of COVID-19
													among
													their
													nearly 500 employees. From turning their polymer lab to making 1,000
													liters
													of sanitizer to requiring thermal temperature checks before coming
													into
													work
													to adding a pause between manufacturing shifts to sterilize the
													factory,
													Prusa’s efforts are to be lauded as the company continues to set an
													example
													for 3-D printing companies today.</p>
												<p>While he is also fighting the potential for normalcy bias in
													recognizing
													that
													relatively severe measures will have to remain in place for some
													time,
													and
													“business as normal” is still quite some ways off, Prusa is keen to
													look
													ahead for both his company and the broader 3-D printing industry.
												</p>
												<p>Life after the pandemic won’t look the same, that’s simply a given.
													But
													for
													Prusa Research, preparation is key to moving forward for that new
													normal.
													There is also hope to be seen — a silver lining that 3-D printing
													may
													step
													more into the mainstream, and this time without the hype.</p>
												<p><cite>“This is a chance for our desktop 3-D community to show as a mature community, not just a bunch of nerds printing toys,”</cite>
													Prusa said with a grin.
													<cite>“For 3-D printing, I think this shows a lot of people that it has a lot of use… This will be a marathon, and I think it might be actually a time for 3-D printers to finally rise because the economics will be cooled down all around the place, I think we can agree on that. And then the 3-D printers are very useful — in right to repair movements, to replace parts, or just to manufacture stuff cheaply, as we have, for example. We have a lot of parts in medical labs. For some uses you have a single-use medical tray that can cost hundreds of euros, but can print it for less. 3-D printing can be very efficient.”</cite>
