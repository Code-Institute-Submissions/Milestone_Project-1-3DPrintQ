# Milestone Project 1

This was created to demonstrate learnings from the Code Institute software development course and marks the first of four milestone projects to be created. It is to showcase html, css and ux by way of a static front end website.

## The 3D Print Q

The3DPrintQ website is a fully responsive website designed to introduce hobbyists to 3D printing. It explains what 3D printing is and directs users to common ‘builds’ so that they can build their own! For the site owner, it’s purpose is to capture email addresses so as to promote paid content and affiliate links.

## User Experience (UX)
### User stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to access the site across a range of devices.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to find additional relevant information.
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to get in contact with the site owner with questions. 
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to locate their social media links to stay up to date with content.
#### Frequent User Goals
* As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added podcasts or videos. 
* As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.
* As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The site uses a total of 5 colours. 
* Green - rgb(53,206,141) #35CE8D
* Blue - rgb(2,142,175) #028EAF
* White - rgb(255,255,255) #FFFFFF
* Grey - rgb () #343A40
* Orange - rgb(255,120,90) #FF785A
#### Typography
* The Roboto font is used on navigational and header elements throughout the site with sans serif as a fall back in case of errors in loading the font. Roboto is a clean and stylish popular choice as Androids default font and so fits the target market of those that are more ‘tech’ orientated. 
* Source Sans Pro is used for all content elements as it is intended for user interface elements and so is a fitting nod to user input screens on 3D printers. 
#### Imagery
The hero image was chosen to show the wide range of things of which an be 3D printed. With it’s vicarious colours it was used so as to be eye catching and as it fit the color scheme of the site.
As branding is alway important, the brand logo is used within the header and the footer. The header is sticky and so keeps the branding in sight at all times. 
#### Wireframes
Insert wireframes here

## Features
* The site is designed to be responsive across all devices.
* The home page uses a carousel feature for the 3 build guides. Their runs and cycles through each option automatically, denotes which one is in view and also allows the user to navigate back and forth. The carousel is also responsive and so works on mobile and tablets.
* All YouTube videos are embedded and can be play/paused by the user. As with all podcasts. 
* The footer is partially visible as you scroll to the bottom and fully reveals itself once the bottom of the page is reached.
* The user can jump back to the top of the page by hitting the “raise Live Z’ button.
* Sign-up opens the sign-up modal. 

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
#### HTML5
* Html5 and semantic markup is the primary language used for the creation of this website.
#### CSS3

#### Javascript/Query
* Whilst not directly written. Javascript/Query is used by Bootstrap for the modals and carousel. 

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
#### Bootstrap v.4.5.3 
* Bootstrap was used throughout the project for it’s responsiveness of the website and styling of the nav bar. 
#### Hover.css	
* Hover.css was used on the build images on the build.html page to add X transition when being hovered over.
#### Google Fonts
* Google fonts were used for the importing of the ‘Roboto’ and ’Source Sans Pro’ fonts to the style.css page which is used throughout the entirety of the site.
#### Font Awesome

#### Favicon
* favIcon was used to create the site favicon by the importing of the image used in the Q of the logo.
#### `Freephototool`	
freephototool.com was used to create the ‘3DPrintQ’ logo and it’s negatives.
#### Balsamic
* Balsamic desktop was used to create initial wireframes of the site. 
#### Figma

#### `Coolors.co`
* Coloors was used to assist with choosing the colour scheme that is used throughout the website. Colours was given a baseline of the Blue and Grey colours which were already present in the logo and navbar.
